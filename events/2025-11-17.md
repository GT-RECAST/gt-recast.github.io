**Premi√®re Journ√©e Th√©matique du GT RECAST**  
üìÖ **Lundi 17 novembre 2025**  
üìç **Salle Dussane, √âcole Normale Sup√©rieure (ENS), 45 rue d'Ulm, Paris**  

## Th√®me

**Raisonnement avec des donn√©es incertaines & Qualit√© des donn√©es**

Le GT **RECAST** a le plaisir d'annoncer sa premi√®re journ√©e th√©matique, qui se tiendra √† Paris.  
Cette journ√©e sera l'occasion de r√©unir la communaut√© acad√©mique et industrielle autour des d√©fis majeurs que repr√©sentent la gestion de l'incertitude et l'√©valuation de la qualit√© des donn√©es.

## Th√©matiques principales  

La journ√©e abordera des sujets tels que (liste non exhaustive) :  

- Repr√©sentation et raisonnement avec des donn√©es incertaines ou incompl√®tes.  
- D√©finition, mesure et garantie de la qualit√© des donn√©es (*Data Quality*).  
- Gestion de l'incoh√©rence dans les bases de donn√©es et les syst√®mes d'information.  
- Impact de l'incertitude et de la qualit√© des donn√©es sur les processus d√©cisionnels.  
- Approches formelles et pratiques pour le nettoyage, la validation et l'enrichissement des donn√©es.

**Title:** Repair-Based Semantics for Querying Inconsistent Data: From Databases to Knowledge Bases and Back

**Abstract:** Consistent query answering was introduced twenty-five years ago as a principled means of querying inconsistent databases. It is based upon a simple idea: when it is impossible or infeasible to identify the true consistent database, then define instead a space of possible repairs (consistent databases that ‚Äòminimally‚Äô differ from the input database) and output those query answers that hold w.r.t. every repair. This approach has subsequently inspired an active line of research within the knowledge representation and reasoning community, which has extended and adapted the framework to the case of inconsistent knowledge bases (consisting of a dataset and an ontology). In this talk, I will survey recent advances on repair-based semantics and highlight the insights that have been gained, considering both the database and ontology settings.

**Bio:** Meghyn Bienvenu is a senior researcher (directrice de recherche) at the CNRS, based at the LaBRI research lab in Bordeaux, France.  Her research interests span a range of topics in AI and database theory, but she is best known for her contributions to knowledge representation and reasoning (KR), in particular, to ontology-mediated query answering and the study of logic-based methods for handling inconsistent data.  Bienvenu's research has been recognized by an invited Early Career Spotlight talk at IJCAI‚Äô16, the 2016 CNRS Bronze Medal in computer science, a keynote talk at KR 2024, and with her coauthors, a 2023 ACM PODS Alberto O. Mendelzon Test-of-Time Award and KR 2024 Ray Reiter Best Paper Award Runner-Up. She has taken on numerous responsibilities within the AI, KR, and database theory communities, notably serving as PC co-chair for KR 2021, associate editor of Artificial Intelligence Journal, and co-director of GDR RADIA.

**Title:** Reasoning over Property Graphs: Leveraging Large Language Models for Automated Data Consistency

**Abstract:** Graph data structures are foundational for modeling complex
relationships across a wide range of domains, including the life
sciences, social media, healthcare, finance, security, and planning.
Property graphs, in particular, have emerged as a dominant paradigm
for encoding semantic relationships due to their expressiveness and
flexibility. However, the increasing adoption of graph databases has
intensified the need for robust mechanisms to ensure data quality and
consistency.
Traditional consistency maintenance techniques‚Äîsuch as domain-specific
rules and mined constraints like functional and entity
dependencies‚Äîface significant limitations in scalability, adaptability
to evolving data, and interpretability by non-experts. In this talk, I
will discuss the emerging role of Large Language Models (LLMs) as a
tool for automatically discovering and refining consistency
constraints in property graphs through guided natural language
prompts.
By bridging symbolic graph representations with the reasoning
capabilities of LLMs, I will also pinpoint promising directions for
automating integrity management in graph systems, along with a wide
array of graph-based reasoning tasks.

**Bio:** Angela Bonifati is a Distinguished Professor of Computer Science at
Lyon 1 University and at the CNRS Liris research lab, where she leads
the Database Group. She is also an Adjunct Professor at the University
of Waterloo in Canada from 2020 and a Senior member of the French
University Institute (IUF) from 2023. Her current research interests
are on several aspects of data management, including graph databases,
knowledge graphs, data integration and their applications to data
science and artificial intelligence. She has co-authored more than 200
publications in top venues of the data management field, including
five Best Paper Awards, two books and an invited paper in ACM Sigmod
Record 2018. She is a recipient of an ERC Advanced Grant 2024
dedicated to leading researchers in Europe. She is the
recipient of the VLDB Women in DB Research Award 2025 and of the IEEE
TCDE Impact Award 2023 as well as a co-recipient of an ACM Sigmod Research Highlights Award 2023.
She is the General Chair of VLDB 2026 and has served as the Program Chair of IEEE ICDE 2025, ACM Sigmod 2022 and EDBT 2020. She is currently an Associate
Editor for the Proceedings of VLDB Vol. 19 and for IEEE TKDE and ACM TODS.
She is the President of the ACM SIGMOD (2025-2029) and was the President of the EDBT Executive Board and Association (2020-2024). She is a member of the IEEE Technical Committee on Data Engineering (2024-2029) and a member of the PVLDB
Board of Trustees (2024- 2029).
